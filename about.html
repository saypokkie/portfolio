                        <p class="about-text">Hello, my name is Pokkie and I'm an 18-year-old young artist looking for a
                            space on
                            platforms as an independent digital illustrator. Currently, I'm attending a Digital Design
                            college to expand my knowledge and to carve out a place in the digital illustration field.

                <h3 class="reenie-beanie-regular about-title">My Story and Goals</h3>
                <p class="story-text">I became interested in the art field since my childhood, whether it was in musical
                    art or illustrations, and I always dreamed of achieving a goal focused on the arts. In the early
                    stages of my adolescence, I began to consider pursuing a career as a cartoonist, as my goal with art
                    has always been to evoke feelings and emotions in people, to elicit strong emotions simply by
                    looking at my illustrations.</p>
                <p class="story-text">Later, at the age of 15, I decided to pursue life solely as an illustrator, and I
                    began my in-depth
                    studies on all aspects of art, from its simplest form of representation to the most complex and
                    heartfelt. I fell in love with the incredible feelings that producing something people would look at
                    with interest and be able to absorb the emotions of art, conveying my message behind the drawings.
                </p>
                <p class="story-text">I underwent many studies of various types, including composition, anatomy, form,
                    colors, among
                    numerous others, and gained experience in some freelance work, expanding my knowledge of digital
                    art. This phase was crucial for the development of my skills and for consolidating my passion for
                    illustration.</p>
                <p class="story-text">Currently, I seek to work with Digital Illustration from home and to convey all
                    the feelings I desire
                    through just one image. I believe in the power of art to communicate and touch people in profound
                    and meaningful ways, and this motivates me to keep improving and exploring new techniques and
                    styles.</p>
                <p class="story-text">My goal is to continue to learn and grow as an artist while sharing my creations
                    with the world and
                    inspiring others through my work. Each illustration is an opportunity to express something unique
                    and to connect emotionally with those who see it.</p>
